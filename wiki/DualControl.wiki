<h4>Introduction</h4>

Encryption is great for information security and all that. But the problem with encryption is... key management. An analogy often bandied about is that we lock our doors but leave the key in the lock. <i>Or under the mat, but that's my personal favourite so ssh-ssh.</i>

<img align=left style="margin-right: 16px" src="http://jroller.com/evanx/resource/Gnome-application-certificate-250-crop.png">

The Payment Card Industry (PCI) has their "Data Security Standard" called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_Card_Industry_Data_Security_Standard">PCI DSS</a>, which advocates common-sense policies for building a secure network and protecting your data. Actually every industry should adopt PCI DSS because it's the only and best thing we got :)

The PCI DSS mandates that PAN's aka <i>Primary Account Numbers</i> aka credit card numbers, must be "rendered unreadable" e.g. encrypted. It goes without saying that other industries also have sensitive data that people might want to steal, governments even ;)

PCI DSS suggests encrypting the key used to encrypt our data. Darn, we try to secure the data-encryption key (DEK), but now we're lumbered with another key, namely a "key-encryption key" (KEK).

PCI requires that manual key management requires "split knowledge and dual control" of keys. The intent is that no single person can extract the clear-text data. 

The glaring problem is that sysadmins are a single person, with God-like access to all our data, and de facto custodian of the proverbial keys to the kindgom. <i>Consequently sysadmins have root access ;)</i>

Naturally, <tt>keytool</tt> is tailored for a single omnipotent admin, not for "dual control" by two half-cocked ones. So we present a <tt>!DualControlGenSecKey</tt> utility for generating secret keys that are really secret, i.e. they are unattainable, even to <i>root</i>.

But then our application can't access those keys either. <i>D'oh!</i> So we must implement dual control of our application in order to load these keys. <i>Woohoo!</i> But then starting our application requires two coordinated people. <i>D'oh!</i> So we'll present a companion crypto server in a follow-up article.

<h4><tt>!DualControlGenSecKey</tt></h4>

Step 1 for any data security endeavour is to generate an encryption key, which preferrably not even root can pwn. For this purpose, there shall be <tt>!DualControlGenSecKey</tt>, as follows.

{{{
public class DualControlGenSecKey { 
    int submissionCount = Integer.getInteger("dualcontrol.submissions", 3);
    String keyAlias = System.getProperty("alias"); 
    String keyStoreLocation = System.getProperty("keystore"); 
    String keyStoreType = System.getProperty("storetype");
    String keyAlg = System.getProperty("keyalg");
    int keySize = Integer.getInteger("keysize");
    
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {        
        new DualControlGenSecKey().start(args);
    }

    void start() throws Exception {
        dualMap = new DualControlReader().readDualMap(keyAlias, submissionCount);
        keyStorePassword = getKeyStorePassword();
        KeyGenerator keyGenerator = KeyGenerator.getInstance(keyAlg);
        keyGenerator.init(keySize);
        secretKey = keyGenerator.generateKey();
        keyStore = loadKeyStore(keyStoreLocation, keyStorePassword);
        KeyStore.Entry entry = new KeyStore.SecretKeyEntry(secretKey);
        for (String dualAlias : dualMap.keySet()) {
            char[] dualPassword = dualMap.get(dualAlias);
            String alias = keyAlias + "-" + dualAlias;
            KeyStore.ProtectionParameter prot = 
                    new KeyStore.PasswordProtection(dualPassword);
            keyStore.setEntry(alias, entry, prot);
        }
        keyStore.store(new FileOutputStream(keyStoreLocation), keyStorePassword);
    }
    ...
}
}}}
where <tt>!DualControlReader</tt> provides a map of "dual aliases" and their secret "dual passwords," and we create a <tt>!KeyStore</tt> entry for each. 

<h4>Demo</h4>

Let's test <tt>!DualControlGenSecKey</tt>.

{{{
  java -Ddualcontrol.submissions=3 -Ddualcontrol.minPassLength=18 \
     -Dkeystore=$keystore -Dstoretype=JCEKS -Dstorepass=$storepass \
     -Dalias=DEK2013 -Dkeyalg=AES -Dkeysize=256 \
     dualcontrol.DualControlGenSecKey
}}}

where we use a <tt>JCEKS</tt>-type keystore for our symmetric secret key, which is specified as 256bit AES, and "DEK2013" is our desired alias to reference this key.  

When three admins have submitted their passwords via SSL TCP/IP socket e.g. where their client cert's <tt>CN</tt> identifies them as <tt>evanx</tt>, <tt>henty</tt> and <tt>brent</tt>, we see that <tt>!DualControlGenSecKey</tt> creates secret key entries under the following "dual aliases."

{{{
$ keytool -keystore $keystore -storetype JCEKS -storepass $storepass -list | grep Entry
DEK2013-brent-henty, 18 Aug 2013, SecretKeyEntry, 
DEK2013-evanx-henty, 18 Aug 2013, SecretKeyEntry, 
DEK2013-brent-evanx, 18 Aug 2013, SecretKeyEntry,
}}}

Actually these three keys are one and the same. However each copy is password-protected using a different "dual password" combination, known to no single person.

<h4><tt>!DualControlConsole</tt></h4>

In order for admins to submit their password via TCP/IP port, there shall be <tt>!DualControlConsole</tt> as follows.

{{{
public class DualControlConsole {
    final static int PORT = 4444;
    final static String HOST = "127.0.0.1";

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Socket socket = DualControlSSLContextFactory.createSSLContext().getSocketFactory().
                createSocket(HOST, PORT);
        DataInputStream dis = new DataInputStream(socket.getInputStream());
        String prompt = dis.readUTF();
        char[] password = System.console().readPassword(
                "Enter passphrase for remote key " + prompt + ": ");
        String errorMessage = DualControlPasswords.getErrorMessage(password);
        if (errorMessage != null) {
            System.err.println(errorMessage);
        } else {
            DataOutputStream dos = new DataOutputStream(socket.getOutputStream());
            dos.writeUTF(new String(password));
            String message = dis.readUTF();
            System.console().writer().println(message);
        }
        socket.close();
    }
}
}}}
where we open an SSL socket to our supposed dual-controlled app listening on port 4444 on <tt>localhost</tt> e.g. port forwarded using <tt>ssh</tt>. We are authenticated and identified by our SSL client cert. We read the prompt for the password e.g. the key alias "DEK2013," submit our password, and finally display a response message e.g. "OK," or otherwise an error message.

{{{
evans@beethoven:~$ java -Ddualcontrol.ssl.keyStore=evanx.jks dualcontrol.DualControlConsole
Enter passphrase for dual control SSL connection:
Enter passphrase for remote key DEK2013: 
OK
}}}

where <tt>DualControlSSLContextFactory</tt> will prompt for the SSL keystore password first.

<img align="right" src="http://jroller.com/evanx/resource/Gnome-preferences-desktop-personal-250-crop.png"/>

A known "bug" is that more Godly sysadmins can socially-engineer other less Godly admins to submit their passwords whilst a malicious socket server has been installed by the most Godly one onto that frikking port! Other naughty tricks that come to mind is the creation of phantom admins, or the impersonation of other admins e.g. during a key generation procedure. A follow-up article might propose some measures to improve admins' level of confidence that they are not having the wool pulled over their eyes.

The workaround for above "bugs" in plain management-speak, is that our "controls" as documented in in our "policies and procedures," prevent or detect such attacks, and dictate the immediate inauguration of appropriate remediation measures. 

On a positive note, we can setup "<i>double</i>-two-factor" authentication whereby the client requires a password-protected <tt>ssh</tt> key for port forwarding, and a password-protected <tt>!KeyStore</tt> for the client-authenticated SSL connection. For both the underlying <tt>ssh</tt> access, and the <tt>SSL</tt> connection over that, the admin needs to <i>have</i> the private key, and <i>know</i> the password that is protecting it, i.e. requires <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication">multi-factor authentication</a>. 

<h4><tt>DualControlSSLContextFactory</tt></h4>

Similarly to the standard <tt>-Dnet.javax.ssl.keyStore</tt> <i>et al</i> command-line options for the default "keyStore" and "trustStore" for SSL sockets, we use <tt>-Ddualcontrol.ssl.keyStore</tt> as below. 

Note that the <tt>-Ddualcontrol.ssl.keyStore</tt> option is our "private keystore" which contains the <i>private</i> key and its certificate, used for SSL e.g. for DSA assymmetric encryption. This should not be confused with our "secret keystore" e.g. which contains a AES <i>secret</i> key for symmetric encryption of our data. 
 
{{{
public class DualControlSSLContextFactory {    

    public static SSLContext createSSLContext() throws Exception {
        char[] keyStorePassword = null;
        char[] keyPassword = null;
        char[] trustStorePassword = null;
        try {
            String keyStoreLocation = System.getProperty("dualcontrol.ssl.keyStore");
            if (keyStoreLocation == null) {
                throw new Exception("Missing -D property: dualcontrol.ssl.keyStore");
            }
            keyStorePassword = getPassword("dualcontrol.ssl.keyStorePassword", null);
            if (keyStorePassword == null) {
                keyStorePassword = System.console().readPassword(
                        "Enter passphrase for dual control SSL connection: ");
            }
            keyPassword = getPassword("dualcontrol.ssl.keyPassword", keyStorePassword);
            String trustStoreLocation =
                    System.getProperty("dualcontrol.ssl.trustStore", keyStoreLocation);
            trustStorePassword =
                    getPassword("dualcontrol.ssl.trustStorePassword", keyStorePassword);
            return createSSLContext(keyStoreLocation, keyStorePassword, keyPassword,
                    trustStoreLocation, trustStorePassword);
        } finally {
            if (keyStorePassword != null) {
                Arrays.fill(keyStorePassword, (char) 0);
            }
            if (keyPassword != null) {
                Arrays.fill(keyPassword, (char) 0);
            }
            if (trustStorePassword != null) {
                Arrays.fill(trustStorePassword, (char) 0);
            }
        }
    }
   
    public static char[] getPassword(String propertyName, char[] defaultValue) {
        String passwordString = System.getProperty(propertyName);
        if (passwordString == null) {
            return defaultValue;
        }
        logger.warn("Dual control password via command-line: " + propertyName);
        return passwordString.toCharArray();
    }
    ...
}
}}}

where we enable keystore passwords to be specified on the command-line e.g. for test scripts, but otherwise we prompt for a password to be entered on the console.

We use the <tt>SSLContext</tt> created above for opening a <tt>SSLSocket</tt> in <tt>!DualControlConsole</tt>, and also for creating an <tt>SSLServerSocket</tt> in <tt>!DualControlReader</tt> as illustrated below.

<h4><tt>!DualControlReader</tt></h4>

Our <tt>!DualControlReader</tt> utility class handles reading split knowledge submissions.

{{{
public class DualControlReader {
    ...
    public Map<String, char[]> readDualMap(String prompt, int submissionCount) throws Exception {
        this.prompt = prompt;
        this.submissionCount = submissionCount;
        Map<String, char[]> map = new TreeMap();
        Map<String, char[]> submissions = readMap();
        for (String name : submissions.keySet()) {
            for (String otherName : submissions.keySet()) {
                if (name.compareTo(otherName) < 0) {
                    String dualAlias = String.format("%s-%s", name, otherName);
                    char[] dualPassword = combineDualPassword(
                            submissions.get(name), submissions.get(otherName));
                    map.put(dualAlias, dualPassword);
                }
            }
        }
        return map;
    }
}}}

If we have three admins e.g. Brent, Evan, and Henty, then we have three combinations of pairs of admins, namely Brent-Evan, Brent-Henty and Evan-Henty, ordered alphabetically. The <tt>compareTo()</tt> in the nested loop above ensures we exclude the likes of <tt>Evan-Brent</tt> in favour of <tt>Brent-Evan</tt>, and the likes of <tt>Evan-Evan</tt>, which is just silly.

We invoke <tt>readMap()</tt> to listen for submissions via an <tt>SSLServerSocket</tt>.

{{{
    private final static int PORT = 4444;
    private final static String LOCAL_ADDRESS = "127.0.0.1";
    private final static String REMOTE_ADDRESS = "127.0.0.1";
    ...
    Map<String, char[]> readMap() throws Exception {
        logger.info("Waiting for submissions on SSL port " + PORT);
        SSLServerSocket serverSocket = (SSLServerSocket) 
                DualControlSSLContextFactory.createSSLContext().
                getServerSocketFactory().createServerSocket(PORT, submissionCount, 
                InetAddress.getByName(LOCAL_ADDRESS));
        serverSocket.setNeedClientAuth(true);
        return readMap(serverSocket);
    }
}}}

where we have hard-wired the <tt>SSLServerSocket</tt> to <tt>localhost</tt> i.e. via the loopback interface e.g. <tt>!DualControlConsole</tt> is invoked in a local <tt>ssh</tt> session, or a remote session using <tt>ssh</tt> port forwarding.

We accumulate the required number of submissions as follows.

{{{    
    Map<String, char[]> readMap(SSLServerSocket serverSocket) throws Exception {        
        Map<String, char[]> map = new TreeMap();
        while (map.size() < submissionCount) {
            SSLSocket socket = (SSLSocket) serverSocket.accept();
            if (!socket.getInetAddress().getHostAddress().equals(REMOTE_ADDRESS)) {
                throw new RuntimeException("Remote host address excluded");
            }
            String username = new X500Name(socket.getSession().getPeerPrincipal().
                    getName()).getCommonName();
            DataOutputStream dos = new DataOutputStream(socket.getOutputStream());
            dos.writeUTF(prompt);
            DataInputStream dis = new DataInputStream(socket.getInputStream());
            char[] password = dis.readUTF().toCharArray();
            String errorMessage = DualControlPasswords.getErrorMessage(password);
            if (errorMessage == null) {
                map.put(username, password);
                dos.writeUTF("OK");
            } else {
                dos.writeUTF(errorMessage);
            }
            socket.close();
        }
        serverSocket.close();
        return map;
    }
}}}

where the admin's username is determined from their SSL cert, in particular the <tt>CN</tt> field.

Incidently, a known bug in the above code, and similarly in <tt>!DualControlConsole</tt>, is that we sometimes create strings containing passwords e.g. <tt>readUTF()</tt> above. These will be cleared by the garbage collector at some stage, whereas a better practice is to use <tt>char</tt> arrays exclusively, and clear these soonest.

<h4>Complexity and length</h4>

We ensure that the default required complexity and/or length of the password is sufficient to counter brute-force attacks.

{{{
public class DualControlPasswords {
    final static boolean verifyPasswordComplexity = 
            getBoolean("dualcontrol.verifyPasswordComplexity", false);
    final static int minPassLength = 
            Integer.getInteger("dualcontrol.minPassLength", 18);

    public static String getErrorMessage(char[] password) throws Exception {
        if (password.length < minPassLength) {
            return "Password too short";
        }
        if (verifyPasswordComplexity) {
            if (!isLetter(password) || !isUpperCase(password) || !isLowerCase(password)
                    || !isDigit(password) || !isPunctuation(password)) {
                return "Insufficient password complexity";
            }
        }
        return null;
    }
    ...
}
}}}

We argue that password length is more practical than complexity, e.g. that a passphrase of 10 lowercase letters and spaces, is preferrable to an 8 character password with uppercase, lowercase and digits.

Importantly, passphrases are easier to remember, so we don't have to write them down and stick them on our monitor. Consequently, we might choose not to enforce password complexity, but rather require longish passphrases.

<img align="right" style="margin-left: 4px" src="http://jroller.com/evanx/resource/gnome-shield-250.png" />

<h4>Brutish Key Protector</h4>

We observe that a quad-core Intel i5 can try about 30 guesses per millisecond, using 4 threads to utilise its cores.

{{{
evans@beethoven:~$ java dualcontrol.JCEKSBruteForceTimer 4 1000000 \
  $seckeystore $pass DEK2013-evanx-henty eeeehhhh

threads 4, count 1000000, avg 0.035ms
28 guesses per millisecond
}}}

Our keystore is unfortunately forever vulnerable to theft and/or brute-force attacks. Even when we have deleted it, someone else might have ill-gotten it earlier. 

The default <a href="http://www.docjar.com/html/api/sun/security/provider/JavaKeyStore.java.html"><tt>!JavaKeyStore</tt></a> i.e. for JKS-type keystores, uses a <a href="http://www.docjar.com/html/api/sun/security/provider/KeyProtector.java.html"><tt>!KeyProtector</tt></a> which hashes the password using <tt>SHA</tt> and XOR's the digest with the key material.

We see that the JCE Provider's <a href="http://www.docjar.com/docs/api/com/sun/crypto/provider/JceKeyStore.html"><tt>JCEKeyStore</tt></a> i.e. for JCEKS-type keystores, uses a <a href="http://www.docjar.com/html/api/com/sun/crypto/provider/KeyProtector.java.html"><tt>!KeyProtector</tt></a> with a PBE cipher, namely <a href="http://www.docjar.com/html/api/com/sun/crypto/provider/PBEWithMD5AndTripleDESCipher.java.html"><tt>PBEWithMD5AndTripleDESCipher</tt></a> with a <a href="http://www.docjar.com/html/api/javax/crypto/spec/PBEKeySpec.java.html"><tt>PBEKeySpec</tt></a> with the default iteration count of zero. 
 
But surely <tt>PBKDF2</tt> with high number of iterations, would be way better at combating brute-force attacks on keystores? One wants a computationally-expensive algorithm so that key recovery takes a second rather than a millisecond. We note that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrypt"><tt>scrypt</tt></a> is also memory-expensive.

So we might want an even stronger <tt>!KeyStore</tt> implementation than the one offered by the Oracle JCE Provider, e.g. with a stronger <tt>!KeyProtector</tt> using <tt>PBKDF2</tt> or <tt>scrypt</tt> with a huge number of iterations. 

Otherwise if we assume that someone can try 1000 guesses per millisecond on a JCE keystore, using a botnet of a 100M machines, and a subset of 20 lowercase letters and spaces, then by my backroom calculations we must require a minimum passphrase length of 18, for which more than 80 years is required to try all possible passwords. Since our admins already have their half the "dual password," each admin's passphrase should be 18 characters, to protect against a rogue admin perpetrating the brute-force attack.

In order to use passphrases shorter than 18 characters with absolute confidence, perhaps we'll implement PBKDF2 to password-protect our keys, in a follow-up article. A trick that comes to mind is to use a separate JCEKS for each dual key, and encrypt the entire keystore using PBE with PBKDF2. The unencrypted <tt>!KeyStore</tt> bytes can be put into <tt>!ByteArrayInputStream</tt> to be passed to <tt>!KeyStore.load()</tt>. On the flip side, we pass a <tt>!ByteArrayOutputStream</tt> to <tt>!KeyStore.store()</tt>, encrypt the resulting <tt>!KeyStore</tt> bytes using the dual password, and save encrypted bytes to the filesystem. In this case, we are unable to use <tt>keytool</tt>, but in any event we require replacements such as <tt>!DualControlGenSecKey</tt>, with more to come.

<h4><tt>!DualControlSessions</tt></h4>

On the downside, we have to re-engineer our application to be dual-controlled, to load the key it so desperately needs to cipher our data.

{{{
public class DualControlDemoApp {
    private SecretKey dek;     
    ...
    private void loadKey(String keyStoreLocation, char[] storePass, String alias) 
            throws Exception {
        dek = DualControlSessions.loadKey(keyStoreLocation, storePass, alias);
    }
}
}}}

where the application loads keys as if it's too easy. But the caveat is that execution is blocked whilst we are waiting for two admins to submit their passwords using <tt>!DualControlConsole</tt>'s.
{{{
public class DualControlSessions {

    public static SecretKey loadKey(String keyStoreLocation, char[] storePass, String alias) 
            throws Exception {
        char[] dualPass = null;
        try {
            KeyStore dualKeyStore = DualControlKeyStores.loadKeyStore(keyStoreLocation, storePass);
            Map.Entry<String, char[]> entry = DualControlReader.readDualEntry(alias);
            String dualAlias = entry.getKey();
            dualPass = entry.getValue();
            return (SecretKey) dualKeyStore.getKey(alias + "-" + dualAlias, dualPass);
        } finally {
            if (dualPass != null) {
                Arrays.fill(dualPass, (char) 0);            
            }
        }        
    }
}
}}}

where we read the dual info using the afore-mentioned <tt>!DualControlReader</tt> (which creates an <tt>SSLServerSocket</tt> on a well-known port e.g. 4444).

<h4>Crypto server</h4>

One might wish to create a central crypto server which is dual-controlled, rather than burden your app. In that case, you can restart your application without dual control, and indeed have any number of apps using this server. This simplifies key management, and enables us to isolate our keys to improve security.

We'll implement the crypto server in a follow-up article. <i>Then we can say, "Dual control? We have an app for that." ;)</i>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

The problem with encryption is secure key management. We shouldn't leave the key under the mat.

<img align="right" style="margin-left: 4px" src="http://jroller.com/evanx/resource/gnome-keys-250.png" />

PCI requires that "split knowledge and dual control" be used to protect our encryption keys so that no single person can acquire them, not even the most trustworthy employee today, rogue tomorrow.

We take the approach of protecting the data-encryption keys using password-based encryption, by using <tt>JCEKeyStore</tt>. We enforce split knowledge of the password, which is effectively a key-encryption key.

In order to generate a dual-controlled key, we propose keeping at least three copies of the same key, but where each copy is password-protected with a different "dual password" to be provided by a given pair of admins. Thereafter, if one admin is on vacation or otherwise indisposed, we don't mind because we only require two admins to load a copy of the key when we restart our app :)

Our omnipresent <tt>keytool</tt> is tailored for a single admin, so we introduce <tt>!DualControlGenSecKey</tt> to generate a secret key in a JCE keystore. This protects copies of the same key using "dual passwords" known to no single person. 

We demonstrate how our app can be dual-controlled to load a key from the store at startup, having read two admins' passwords via a client-authenticated <tt>SSLServerSocket</tt>.

To complete the picture, we provide a trivial <tt>!DualControlConsole</tt> utility for admins to submit their password from their <tt>ssh</tt> console using a client <tt>SSLSocket</tt>. We can setup "double-two-factor" remote authentication whereby the client requires a password-protected <tt>ssh</tt> key for port forwarding (for the required <tt>localhost</tt> loopback access), in addition to the password-protected <tt>!KeyStore</tt> for the client SSL connection.

For increased protection against brute-force attacks, we might wish for an even stronger <tt>!KeyStore</tt> implementation than offered by the Oracle JCE Provider, in particular with a stronger <tt>!KeyProtector</tt> using <tt>PBKDF2</tt> or <tt>scrypt</tt>. Ideally it should be configurable with the largest number of iterations such that the average key recovery time is still an acceptable delay for startup in our production environment e.g. a number of seconds. But as things stand, we use the standard <tt>JCE</tt> keystore, for which we suggest a minimum passphrase length of 18 characters, by a somewhat arbitrary calculation.

In a follow-up article, we'll implement a dual-controlled crypto server, to unburden our apps, improve convenience, but more importantly, to isolate our keys on the crypto server, to simplify key management, to enhance security. 

We will also need other tools similar to <tt>!DualControlGenSec</tt>, to enroll and revoke admins i.e. to handle staff changes.  We'll present <tt>!DualControlEnroll</tt> and <tt>!DualControlRevoke</tt> in a yet another sequel. 

A further sequel will work through "key rotation" e.g. migrating from a dated "DEK2013" key a to revised "DEK2014" key.

Finally, we'll consider stronger protection against brute-force attacks of the key password e.g. using <tt>PBKDF2</tt> with a huge number of iterations.
