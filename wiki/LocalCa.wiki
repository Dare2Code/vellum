#labels SSL, keytool, Java

<h4>Overview</h4>

We consider innumerable clients connecting to a Java server over SSL sockets. 

Naturally, we generate certificates for each client, and typically import these self-signed certificates into our server truststore.

In this article, we sign client certificates using our server certificate as a local root CA certificate. As such, our server should support certificate revocation.

<h4>Certificate chain</h4>

Naturally an <tt>SSLServerSocket</tt> is created using an <tt>SSLContext</tt>, which is configured with a keystore and a truststore.

{{{
public class LocalCaTest {
    ...
    private void accept(KeyStore keyStore, char[] keyPassword, KeyStore trustStore, 
            int port) throws GeneralSecurityException, IOException {
        SSLContext sslContext = SSLContexts.create(keyStore, keyPassword, trustStore);
        SSLServerSocket serverSocket = (SSLServerSocket) sslContext.
                getServerSocketFactory().createServerSocket(port);
        serverSocket.setNeedClientAuth(true);
        Socket socket = serverSocket.accept();
        try {
            DataInputStream dis = new DataInputStream(socket.getInputStream());
            Assert.assertEquals("clienthello", dis.readUTF());
            DataOutputStream dos = new DataOutputStream(socket.getOutputStream());
            dos.writeUTF("serverhello");
        } finally {
            socket.close();
        }
    }
}
}}}

The keystore must contain our asymmetric private key and its public key certificate. Moreover, it must contain the entire certificate chain of that key certificate right through to its root certificate. We list the certicate chain as follows.
{{{
$ keytool -keystore server.jks -alias server -list -v
Enter keystore password: 
Certificate chain length: 2
Certificate[1]:
Owner: CN=server, OU=test
Issuer: CN=ca, OU=test
Certificate[2]:
Owner: CN=ca, OU=test
Issuer: CN=ca, OU=test
}}}
where our CA cert is by definition the self-signed root of our certificate chain.

We can use <tt>openssl</tt> to connect to the <tt>SSLServerSocket</tt> and inspect its key certificate chain as follows.
{{{
$ openssl s_client -connect localhost:4444

Certificate chain
 0 s:/OU=test/CN=server
   i:/OU=test/CN=ca
 1 s:/OU=test/CN=ca
   i:/OU=test/CN=ca
}}}

This demonstrates why the keystore requires a certificate chain, i.e. to send to the peer for authentication. The peer receives the chain, and authenticates it, stopping as soon as it encounters a certificate that it trusts. Therefore the chain for a trusted cert need not be stored in the truststore, and actually must not be, otherwise we trust <i>any</i> children of the trusted cert's root. 

The server truststore contains trusted certificates to authenticate the client key certificate chain. 
{{{
$ keytool -keystore server.trust.jks -list 
Enter keystore password: 
Your keystore contains 1 entry
server, trustedCertEntry
}}}
where our client certificates will be signed by the server certificate. Notice that the certificate chain of this trusted certificate is not installed in the truststore.


<h4>SSLContexts</h4>

Ordinarily we create an <tt>SSLContext</tt> as follows.
{{{
public class SSLContexts {
    ...
    public static SSLContext create(KeyStore keyStore, char[] keyPassword,
            KeyStore trustStore) throws Exception {
        KeyManagerFactory keyManagerFactory = KeyManagerFactory.getInstance("SunX509");
        keyManagerFactory.init(keyStore, keyPassword);
        TrustManagerFactory trustManagerFactory = TrustManagerFactory.getInstance("SunX509");
        trustManagerFactory.init(trustStore);
        SSLContext sslContext = SSLContext.getInstance("TLS");
        sslContext.init(keyManagerFactory.getKeyManagers(),
                trustManagerFactory.getTrustManagers(), new SecureRandom());
        return sslContext;
    }
}
}}}

Since we wish to support a local CA, we should enable local certificate revocation, in order to retain access control. We see that <tt><a href="http://www.docjar.org/html/api/java/security/cert/X509Certificate.java.html">!X509Certificate</a></tt> returns a <tt>!BigInteger</tt> for the serial number, that should be unique. Incidently, this is implemented by <a href="http://www.docjar.org/html/api/sun/security/x509/X509CertImpl.java.html"><tt>!X509CertImpl</tt></a>.

So we create an <tt>SSLContext</tt> with a set of revoked certificate serial numbers, as follows.
{{{
public class RevocableSSLContexts {
    ...
    public static SSLContext create(KeyStore keyStore, char[] keyPass,
            KeyStore trustStore, Set<BigInteger> revokedSerialNumbers) throws Exception {
        KeyManagerFactory keyManagerFactory = KeyManagerFactory.getInstance("SunX509");
        keyManagerFactory.init(keyStore, keyPass);
        SSLContext sslContext = SSLContext.getInstance("TLS");
        TrustManager revocableTrustManager = new RevocableClientTrustManager(
                getPrivateKeyCertificate(keyStore),
                getX509TrustManager(trustStore),
                revokedList);
        sslContext.init(keyManagerFactory.getKeyManagers(),
                new TrustManager[]{revocableTrustManager},
                new SecureRandom());
        return sslContext;
    }
}
}}}
where we initialise a custom <tt>!RevocableClientTrustManager</tt> with our server cert, and a set of revoked certificates' serial numbers.
{{{
public class RevocableClientTrustManager implements X509TrustManager {
    X509Certificate serverCertificate;
    X509TrustManager delegate;
    Set<BigInteger> revokedSerialNumbers;
    ...
    @Override
    public void checkClientTrusted(X509Certificate[] certs, String authType) 
            throws CertificateException {
        if (!certs[0].getSubjectX500Principal().equals(
                serverCertificate.getSubjectX500Principal())) {
            throw new CertificateException("Server cert used as client cert");
        }
        if (!certs[0].getIssuerX500Principal().equals(
                serverCertificate.getSubjectX500Principal())) {
            throw new CertificateException("Untrusted issuer");
        }
        if (!Arrays.equals(certs[1].getPublicKey().getEncoded(),
                serverCertificate.getPublicKey().getEncoded())) {
            throw new CertificateException("Invalid server certificate");
        }
        if (revokedSerialNumbers.contains(certs[0].getSerialNumber())) {
            throw new CertificateException("Certificate serial number revoked");
        }
        delegate.checkClientTrusted(certs, authType);
    }
}
}}}
where we check that the client certificate is signed by our server certificate, and not revoked. Finally, we delegate to the standard <tt>!X509TrustManager</tt> for good measure.

Notice that we do not accept the server cert as a client cert. This is a precaution in case our server keystore has been compromised, and a rogue is using it to connect to our server.

The set of revoked certificates' identifiers might be read from a file or a database. This could be a synchronized set that can be updated concurrently, and so enables a dynamic truststore, which we test as follows.
{{{
    private void testDynamicRevocation(KeyStore serverKeyStore, KeyStore serverTrustStore, 
            KeyStore clientKeyStore, KeyStore clientTrustStore, 
            int serialNumber) throws Exception {
        logger.info("testRevoke: " + serialNumber);
        Set<BigInteger> revokedSerialNumbers = new ConcurrentSkipListSet();
        SSLContext serverSSLContext = RevocableSSLContexts.createRevokedSerialNumbers(
                serverKeyStore, pass, serverTrustStore, revokedSerialNumbers);
        SSLContext clientSSLContext = SSLContexts.create(clientKeyStore, pass, clientTrustStore);
        ServerThread serverThread = new ServerThread();
        serverThread.start(serverSSLContext, port, 2);
        Assert.assertEquals("", ClientThread.connect(clientSSLContext, port));
        Assert.assertEquals("", serverThread.getErrorMessage());
        revokedSerialNumbers.add(new BigInteger("" + serialNumber));
        clientSSLContext = SSLContexts.create(clientKeyStore, pass, clientTrustStore);
        Assert.assertEquals("", ClientThread.connect(clientSSLContext, port));
        Assert.assertEquals("", serverThread.getErrorMessage());
    }
}}}
where we create a concurrent set for the revoked certificates, and revoke a client certificate after the server has been started. Before the certificate is revoked, the connection should succeed, and afterwards it should fail. Incidently, we find that the client session is cached for the SSL context, and create a new <tt>clientSSLContext</tt> instance to force re-authentication by the server.

Incidently, <a href="http://www.docjar.org/html/api/sun/security/tools/KeyTool.java.html"><tt>!KeyTool.java</tt></a>, as used by the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/tools/solaris/keytool.html"><tt>keytool</tt></a> command-line utility, generates a random serial number as follows.
{{{
        info.set(X509CertInfo.SERIAL_NUMBER, new CertificateSerialNumber(
            new java.util.Random().nextInt() & 0x7fffffff));
}}}

In a later article, we might build a local CA management tool, which might use a sequence number for client certs which it generates programmatically and records them into an SQL database.


<h4><tt>keytool</tt></h4>

Naturally we use <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/tools/solaris/keytool.html"><tt>keytool</tt></a> to create our keystores and truststores. For example, we create a private SSL keystore for a client, say evanx, as follows.
{{{
$ keytool -keystore evanx.jks -genkeypair -keyalg rsa -keysize 2048 -validity 365 -alias evanx \
    -dname "CN=evanx, OU=test"
}}}
where we specify a validity period of 365 days.
 
We export our certificate as follows.
{{{
$ keytool -keystore evanx.jks -alias evanx -exportcert -rfc
}}}
We cut and paste the exported PEM text into a file, which we can inspect using <tt>openssl</tt> as follows.
{{{
$ openssl x509 -text -in evanx.pem
Certificate:
    Data:
        Version: 3 (0x2)
        Serial Number: 1380030508 (0x5241982c)
    Signature Algorithm: sha1WithRSAEncryption
        Issuer: CN=evanx, OU=test
        Validity
            Not Before: Sep 24 13:48:28 2013 GMT
            Not After : Sep 24 13:48:28 2014 GMT
        Subject: CN=evanx, OU=test
        Subject Public Key Info:
            Public Key Algorithm: rsaEncryption
                Public-Key: (2048 bit)
}}}
We import the client cert into the server SSL truststore.
{{{
$ keytool -keystore server.trust.jks -alias evanx -importcert -file evanx.pem
}}}
Similarly, the server cert is imported into the clients' truststores.

Incidently, in a follow-up article we will create keystores programmatically for our unit tests, taking cues from <a href="http://www.docjar.org/html/api/sun/security/tools/KeyTool.java.html"><tt>!KeyTool</tt></a>, and emulating the manual procedure.

<h4>Client certificate signing</h4>

Alternatively, we might export a certificate signing request (CSR) as follows, and sign this with the server cert. In this case our server is a local CA where we will trust any of its issued certiticates. So we must support certificate revocation to control access.
{{{
$ keytool -keystore evanx.jks -alias evanx -certreq
}}}
We cut and paste the output PEM text into a CSR file, and use Java7's keytool to sign this CSR, using its new <tt>-gencert</tt> option, which by the way is not available in earlier JRE's.
{{{
$ keytool -keystore server.jks -gencert -validity 365 -rfc \
    -dname "CN=evanx, OU=test" -infile evanx.csr -outfile evanx.signed.pem
}}}
where we specify an unchanged DN and validity period for the newly signed certificate.

We can inspect the cert using <tt>openssl</tt>.
{{{
$ openssl x509 -text -in evanx.signed.pem | grep CN
        Issuer: CN=server, OU=test
        Subject: CN=evanx, OU=test
}}}

Since the keystore requires its key certificate chain to be imported in the correct order starting with the root cert, we import the server cert first, and then our signed cert.
{{{
$ keytool -keystore evanx.jks -importcert -noprompt \
    -file server.pem -alias server 
Enter keystore password: 
Certificate was added to keystore

$ keytool -keystore evanx.jks -importcert -noprompt \
    -file evanx.signed.pem -alias evanx
Enter keystore password: 
Certificate reply was installed in keystore
}}}

In this case, our client keystore can double up as our truststore since it happens to contain the server cert by virtue of its certificate chain, and naturally it must trust the server to which it wishes to connect. If the client cert is CA-signed, we must not use its keystore as its truststore, otherwise it would trust any server with a cert signed by that CA, since the CA certificate must be in the keystore as the root of the key certificate chain.

<img align="right" style="margin-left: 4px" src="http://jroller.com/evanx/resource/gnome-keys-250.png" />

Our server keystore can also double up as its truststore in this particular case, since naturally it contains the self-signed server cert (paired with its private key), and our client certs' CA cert is in fact this server cert.

If our server cert is CA-signed, then since the keystore must include its key certificate chain, it will include the CA root cert. Therefore if the keystore is misused as the trustore, then the server would trust <i>any</i> client cert signed by that CA.

<h4>Client certificate management</h4>

Clearly a certificate with a duplicate CN, impersonates the original certificate with that CN. So when issuing a client certificate, we must take care to ensure the uniqueness of the CN, and add the certificate or at least its unique identifier to a registry of some sort. 

If a certificate is signed but not recorded, or its record is deleted, our server is forever vulnerable to that rogue certificate. In order to review access, we clearly require a perfect record of all issued certificates. So we might record our signed certs into a keystore file as follows.
{{{
$ keytool -keystore server.issued.jks -importcert -alias evanx -file evanx.pem 
Certificate was added to keystore
}}}
where this is not a truststore per se, but just a database of issued certificates. 

Interestingly, in trying to avoid a truststore containing all our client certificates, we have nevertheless ended up with one! 

<h4>Self-signed client certificates</h4>

All told, given the risk of a rogue certificate, we recommend using self-signed client certificates which are explicitly imported into our server truststore, where can be reviewed. Any issued certificate which goes unrecorded or is given a duplicate identifier by mistake or on purpose, is a vulnerability.

Note that when using self-signed client certs (or CA-signed server certs), the server keystore must not be used as its truststore, since the keystore naturally contains the server certificate, and so a rogue certificate can be created by signing it with the server key, e.g. using <tt>keytool -gencert</tt>, as illustrated above. 

Similarly, when using CA-signed server certs, the server keystore contains the CA root key, and so must not be used as the truststore. Otherwise any client cert signed by that CA would trusted, rather than just the client certs we have specifically added to the truststore.

<img align="right" src="http://jroller.com/evanx/resource/Gnome-application-certificate-250-crop.png">

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

We can sign client certificates using our server certificate, which is then our local CA root certificate. As such we should support certification revocation. So we introduce a custom SSL trust manager to support a local revocation list. Naturally this is only useful is if we can configure our server to use it!

In this special case, we can use our keystore as our truststore, which we argue is a practice that should be prohibited ordinarily.

We discuss the risk of rogue certificates, and recommend using self-signed client certificates whenever possible, rather than a local CA as presented here.

<h4>Furthermore</h4>

We'll perform unit testing of our custom trust manager in a follow-up article. Thereafter, we might implement a local CA management tool that records issued certificates, a local CA server supporting standard CRLs, and perhaps even a web-based admin tool for these goodies.
