== Introduction == 

We write lots of cron scripts to perform routine maintenance tasks on our systems, so... 

We might want a script to perform various tasks in succession, but able to invoke those individually e.g. to test them.

== Template == 

The following is a basic template.

{{{
set -o nounset

command1_df() { # partition
  partition=$1
  df -h | grep $1
}

command0_default() { # no args
  echo "The following commands are available:" 
  cat $0 | grep '^command[0-9]_' | sed 's/^command\([0-9]\)_\(.*\)() { # \(.*\)/\2: \1 args: \3/'
}

invoke() {
  if [ $# -gt 0 ]
  then
    command=$1
    shift
  else
    command=default
  fi
  command$#_$command $@
}

invoke $@
}}}

Firstly we always set "nounset" so that if our script encounters an unset variable, this is treated as an safe bug, and the script exits.

If no command-line arguments are provided, we will invoke the method <tt>command0_default()</tt>.

The above implementation of <tt>command0_default()</tt> actually lists all the methods at our command, where we document the required arguments in the script itself. 

{{{
evanx@beethoven:~$ sh scripts/test.sh
The following commands are available:
df: 1 args: partition
default: 0 args: no args
}}}

We can invoke the command <tt>df</tt> with one argument which is the partition. Actually we see in the <tt>command1_df()</tt> method that this argument is just a pattern we grep from the output of <tt>df</tt> 

{{{
evanx@beethoven:~$ sh scripts/test.sh df home
/dev/sdb2             128G  109G   13G  90% /home
}}}

If we do not provide the correct number of arguments that the method is expected, the script will abort as follows, courtesy of the <tt>nounset</tt>. 

{{{
evanx@beethoven:~$ sh scripts/test.sh df 
scripts/test.sh: 25: command0_df: not found
}}}

If we provide an invalid command, the script will abort as follows, courtesy of the <tt>nounset</tt>. 

{{{
evans@beethoven:~$ sh scripts/test.sh dff home
scripts/test.sh: 25: command1_dff: not found
}}}

== Conclusion == 

We suggest a simple trick for invoking methods in a bash script, where the script can self-document any arguments required by that method. 

The implementation will ensure <tt>command</tt> methods are invoked with the correct number of arguments, by virtue of the using the number of arguments in the method name e.g. <tt>command1_</tt> will prefix methods requiring one argument only.
