
== Timestamped, a trilogy in a few parts == 

We herewith begin a saga about monitoring with this series entitled "Timestamped: a trilogy in a few parts," this being the first part, where we introduce a map to count key things, and ensure we can sort it by its integer values.

We will be analysing logs in this unwinding series. Ultimately we gonna hook up a remote Log4j appender to digest our logs to gather stats, and make some judgement calls as to the rapidly changing status of our app.
