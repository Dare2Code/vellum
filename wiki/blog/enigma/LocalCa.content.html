<h4>SSLContext</h4>

Naturally an SSLServerSocket is created using an SSLContext, which is initialized via a keystore and a truststore, as in the following example.

<pre>
public class LocalCaTest {
    ...
    static void accept(KeyStore keyStore, char[] keyPassword, KeyStore trustStore,
            int port) throws GeneralSecurityException, IOException {
        KeyManagerFactory keyManagerFactory = KeyManagerFactory.getInstance("SunX509");
        keyManagerFactory.init(keyStore, keyPassword);
        TrustManagerFactory trustManagerFactory = TrustManagerFactory.getInstance("SunX509");
        trustManagerFactory.init(trustStore);
        SSLContext sslContext = SSLContext.getInstance("TLS");
        sslContext.init(keyManagerFactory.getKeyManagers(),
                trustManagerFactory.getTrustManagers(), new SecureRandom());
        SSLServerSocket serverSocket = (SSLServerSocket) sslContext.
                getServerSocketFactory().createServerSocket(port);
        try {
            serverSocket.setNeedClientAuth(true);
            handle(serverSocket.accept());
        } finally {
            serverSocket.close();
        }
    }    
}
</pre>
where we create an SSL context for our server socket, and accept a client connection.

The keystore must contain our asymmetric private key, which naturally is paired with its public key certificate. Moreover, the keystore must contain the certificate chain of that key certificate, through to its root certificate. We'll see further below that keytool will not allow a signed certificate to be imported unless its parent certificate chain is already present in the keystore.


<h4>Server certificate signing</h4>

Naturally we create a keystore containing a private key and its self-signed cert using keytool -genkeypair.
<pre>
$ keytool -keystore server.jks -genkeypair -alias server -dname "CN=server" \
  -keyalg rsa -keysize 2048 -validity 365 -noprompt
</pre>
where we specify a validity period of 365 days.

We export a certificate signing request as follows.
<pre>
$ keytool -keystore server.jks -alias server -certreq -rfc -file server.csr
</pre>
We create a signing key. Actually this is our "local CA" certificate.
<pre>
$ keytool -keystore ca.jks -genkeypair -alias ca -dname "CN=ca" \
  -keyalg rsa -keysize 2048 -validity 365 -noprompt
</pre>
Incidently, our server might reside in a DMZ accessible to the Internet, whereas our "CA" key is on a more secure internal machine.

We can sign the CSR using using Java7's keytool -gencert.
<pre>
$ keytool -keystore ca.jks -alias ca -gencert -infile server.csr -dname "CN=server" \
    -validity 365 -rfc -outfile server.signed.pem \
    -ext BasicConstraints:critical=ca:false,pathlen:0 \
    -ext KeyUsage:critical=keyEncipherment \
    -ext ExtendedKeyUsage:critical=serverAuth
</pre>
where we set X509v3 extensions to restrict the key usage, for good measure, e.g. as per a cheap certificate we have bought from !GoDaddy.com. 

We now wish to import this signed certificate reply into our server keystore. As mentioned earlier, keytool will not allow a signed certificate to be imported unless its parent certificate chain is already present in the keystore.
<pre>
$ keytool -keystore server.jks -alias server -importcert -file server.signed.pem
Enter keystore password:
keytool error: java.lang.Exception: Failed to establish chain from reply
</pre>
where the signed certificate is a so-called "reply" to its certificate signing request.

So we must import the certificate chain in order starting with the root certificate.
<pre>
$ keytool -keystore server.jks -alias ca -importcert -file ca.pem
</pre>
An "intermediate" certificate would be next, if we have one. Finally we import the signed certificate reply.
<pre>
$ keytool -keystore server.jks -alias server -importcert -file server.signed.pem
</pre>


<h4>Certificate chain</h4>

We can list the certicate chain as follows.
<pre>
$ keytool -keystore server.jks -alias server -list -v

Certificate chain length: 2

Certificate[1]:
Owner: CN=server
Issuer: CN=ca

Certificate[2]:
Owner: CN=ca
Issuer: CN=ca
</pre>
where we have signed our server cert with a local root CA cert, where by definition the "root" certificate of our chain is self-signed.


<h4>Server truststore</h4>

Our server truststore will contain the CA certificate, which signs our client certs.
<pre>
$ keytool -keystore server.trust.jks -alias ca -importcert -noprompt -file ca.pem
</pre>

Note that by definition, any remote certificate whose chain contains a certificate in the truststore, is trusted. Therefore since our client certificate chain contains our CA certificate, it will be trusted.

<h4>openssl</h4>

We can use openssl to connect to the SSLServerSocket and inspect its key certificate chain as follows.
<pre>
$ openssl s_client -connect localhost:4444

Certificate chain
 0 s:/CN=server
   i:/CN=ca
 1 s:/CN=ca
   i:/CN=ca

Acceptable client certificate CA names
/CN=ca
</pre>
where the subject and issuer of the two certificates in our key certificate chain are listed, and our server will accept client certificates whose chain includes the CA certificate, i.e. as its root certificate. If we are using an intermediate CA certificate to sign the client certs, then that would be imported into the truststore rather than the root certificate.

This demonstrates why the keystore requires a certificate chain, i.e. to send to the peer for authentication. The peer receives the chain, and authenticates it, stopping as soon as it encounters a certificate that it trusts. Therefore the chain for a trusted certificate need not be stored in the truststore, and actually must not be, otherwise we trust <i>any</i> children of the trusted cert's root. If that root is a public CA e.g. !GoDaddy.com, then clearly it must not be included in our truststore.

<h4>Intermediate CA certificate</h4>

In practice, we might have multiple servers with different sets of clients. So we might generate an intermediate certificate that is used to sign client certificates for a specific server.

<pre>
$ keytool -keystore intermediate1.jks -genkeypair -alias intermediate1 -dname "CN=intermediate1" \
    -keyalg rsa -keysize 2048 -validity 365 -noprompt 
</pre>
where this keystore resides on our secure CA server, and not in the DMZ.

We can then use this intermediate CA key to sign the client certs for some server, and as such its truststore contains this CA certificate, in order to trust all its clients in one fell swoop. Clearly, it is not a <i>root</i> CA certificate, but since it can sign certificates, it is a "CA certificate" nonetheless.

Note that the problem with signing client certificates with the server key, is that the server is not as secure as our CA since it resides in the DMZ, and if compromised, could be used to sign rogue certificates.


<h4>Serial numbers</h4>

Incidently, <a href="http://www.docjar.org/html/api/sun/security/tools/KeyTool.java.html">KeyTool.java</a>, as used by the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/tools/solaris/keytool.html">keytool</a> command-line utility, generates a random serial number as follows.
<pre>
        info.set(X509CertInfo.SERIAL_NUMBER, new CertificateSerialNumber(
            new java.util.Random().nextInt() & 0x7fffffff));
</pre>

We see that <a href="http://www.docjar.org/html/api/java/security/cert/X509Certificate.java.html">X509Certificate</a> (implemented by <a href="http://www.docjar.org/html/api/sun/security/x509/X509CertImpl.java.html">X509CertImpl</a>) returns a BigInteger for the certificate serial number, which should be unique, and can be used for revocation.

In a later article, we might build a local CA management tool, which uses a sequence number for certs which it generates programmatically and records in an SQL database.


<h4>SSLContexts</h4>

Ordinarily we create an SSLContext as follows.
<pre>
public class SSLContexts {
    ...
    public static SSLContext create(KeyStore keyStore, char[] keyPassword,
            KeyStore trustStore) throws Exception {
        KeyManagerFactory keyManagerFactory = KeyManagerFactory.getInstance("SunX509");
        keyManagerFactory.init(keyStore, keyPassword);
        TrustManagerFactory trustManagerFactory = TrustManagerFactory.getInstance("SunX509");
        trustManagerFactory.init(trustStore);
        SSLContext sslContext = SSLContext.getInstance("TLS");
        sslContext.init(keyManagerFactory.getKeyManagers(),
                trustManagerFactory.getTrustManagers(), new SecureRandom());
        return sslContext;
    }
}
</pre>
where we provide the keystore and truststore for this SSL context, which can be used to create an SSLServerSocket, or client SSLSocket.

Since we wish to support a local CA for client certificates, we should enable local certificate revocation in order to retain access control. For convenience, we'll revoke certificates by their common name (CN), which must be unique.

So we create an SSLContext with a set of revoked names, as follows.
<pre>
public class RevocableNameSSLContexts {
    ...
    public static SSLContext create(KeyStore keyStore, char[] keyPass,
            KeyStore trustStore, Set<String> revokedNames) throws Exception {
        KeyManagerFactory keyManagerFactory = KeyManagerFactory.getInstance("SunX509");
        keyManagerFactory.init(keyStore, keyPass);
        SSLContext sslContext = SSLContext.getInstance("TLS");
        TrustManager revocableTrustManager = new RevocableTrustManager(
                KeyStores.findSoleTrustedCertificate(keyStore),
                KeyStores.findX509TrustManager(trustStore),
                revokedNames);
        sslContext.init(keyManagerFactory.getKeyManagers(),
                new TrustManager[] {revocableTrustManager},
                new SecureRandom());
        return sslContext;
    }
}
</pre>
where we initialise a custom RevocableTrustManager with our client certificate issuer and a set of revoked names.
<pre>
public class RevocableTrustManager implements X509TrustManager {
    X509Certificate issuerCertificate;
    X509TrustManager delegate;
    Set<String> revokedNames;
    ...
    @Override
    public void checkClientTrusted(X509Certificate[] certs, String authType) 
            throws CertificateException {
        if (certs.length < 2) {
            throw new CertificateException("Invalid cert chain length");
        }
        if (!certs[0].getIssuerX500Principal().equals(
                issuerCertificate.getSubjectX500Principal())) {
            throw new CertificateException("Untrusted issuer");
        }
        if (!Arrays.equals(certs[1].getPublicKey().getEncoded(),
                issuerCertificate.getPublicKey().getEncoded())) {
            throw new CertificateException("Untrusted issuer public key");
        }
        if (revokedNames.contains(X509Certificates.getCN(certs[0].getSubjectDN()))) {
            throw new CertificateException("Certificate CN revoked");
        }
        delegate.checkClientTrusted(certs, authType);
    }
}
</pre>
where we check that the client certificate is issued by our CA, and not revoked. Finally, we delegate to the standard <a href="http://www.docjar.org/html/api/javax/net/ssl/X509TrustManager.java.html">X509TrustManager</a> (implemented by <a href="http://www.docjar.org/html/api/sun/security/ssl/X509TrustManagerImpl.java.html">X509TrustManagerImpl</a>) for good measure, e.g. to validate the certificate chain, expiry dates and what-not, using <a href="http://www.docjar.org/html/api/sun/security/validator/PKIXValidator.java.html">PKIXValidator</a>.

Since we use this trust manager on the server, to validate clients, we do not expect its checkServerTrusted() method to be invoked.
<pre>
    @Override
    public void checkServerTrusted(X509Certificate[] certs, String authType) 
            throws CertificateException {
        throw new CertificateException("Server authentication not supported");
    }    
</pre>

<h4>Dynamic revocation</h4>

The set of revoked certificates' identifiers might be read from a file, URL or database. This could be a synchronized Set that can be updated concurrently, and so enables a dynamic truststore, which we test as follows.
<pre>
public class LocalCaTest {
    ...
    private void testDynamicNameRevocation(KeyStore serverKeyStore, KeyStore serverTrustStore,
            KeyStore clientKeyStore, KeyStore clientTrustStore, String revokedName) 
            throws Exception {
        Set<String> revokedNames = new ConcurrentSkipListSet();
        SSLContext serverSSLContext = RevocableNameSSLContexts.create(
                serverKeyStore, pass, serverTrustStore, revokedNames);
        SSLContext clientSSLContext = SSLContexts.create(clientKeyStore, pass, clientTrustStore);
        ServerThread serverThread = new ServerThread();
        try {
            serverThread.start(serverSSLContext, port, 2);
            Assert.assertNull(ClientThread.connect(clientSSLContext, port));
            Assert.assertNull(serverThread.getErrorMessage());
            revokedNames.add(revokedName);
            clientSSLContext = SSLContexts.create(clientKeyStore, pass, clientTrustStore);
            String errorMessage = ClientThread.connect(clientSSLContext, port);
            Assert.assertEquals("java.security.cert.CertificateException: " + 
                    "Certificate CN revoked", serverThread.getErrorMessage());
            Assert.assertNotNull(errorMessage);
        } finally {
            serverThread.close();
            serverThread.join(1000);
        }
    }
    ...
</pre>
where we create a concurrent Set for the revoked certificates, and revoke a client certificate after the server has been started. Before the certificate is revoked, the connection should succeed, and afterwards it should fail. 

Incidently, we find that the client session is cached for the SSL context, and so we recreate the clientSSLContext instance in our test above. This forces re-initialisation of the client session, and so re-authentication by the server, so that our trust manager is actually invoked and rejects our newly revoked certificate. Perhaps the reader can advise how to disable this client session caching for our unit test?

We connect to the server socket as follows.
<pre>
    static String connect(SSLContext context, int port) 
            throws GeneralSecurityException, IOException {
        SSLSocket socket = (SSLSocket) context.getSocketFactory().
                createSocket(HOST, port);
        try {
            DataOutputStream dos = new DataOutputStream(socket.getOutputStream());
            dos.writeUTF("clienthello");
            DataInputStream dis = new DataInputStream(socket.getInputStream());
            Assert.assertEquals("serverhello", dis.readUTF());
            return null;
        } catch (Exception e) {
            return e.getMessage();
        } finally {
            socket.close();
        }
    }
</pre>
where we return the error message, otherwise null.


<h4>Client keystore</h4>

For example, we create a private SSL keystore for a test client named "evanx" as follows.
<pre>
$ keytool -keystore evanx.jks -genkeypair -keyalg rsa -keysize 2048 -validity 365 -alias evanx \
    -dname "CN=evanx"
</pre>
 
We export our certificate as follows.
<pre>
$ keytool -keystore evanx.jks -alias evanx -exportcert -rfc
</pre>
We cut and paste the exported PEM text into a file, which we can inspect using openssl as follows.
<pre>
$ openssl x509 -text -in evanx.pem
Certificate:
    Data:
        Version: 3 (0x2)
        Serial Number: 1380030508 (0x5241982c)
    Signature Algorithm: sha1WithRSAEncryption
        Issuer: CN=evanx
        Validity
            Not Before: Sep 24 13:48:28 2013 GMT
            Not After : Sep 24 13:48:28 2014 GMT
        Subject: CN=evanx
        Subject Public Key Info:
            Public Key Algorithm: rsaEncryption
                Public-Key: (2048 bit)
</pre>
We import the client cert into the server SSL truststore.
<pre>
$ keytool -keystore server.trust.jks -alias evanx -importcert -file evanx.pem
</pre>
Similarly, our server's CA cert is imported into this client's truststore.

Incidently, in a follow-up article we will create keystores programmatically for our unit tests, taking cues from <a href="http://www.docjar.org/html/api/sun/security/tools/KeyTool.java.html">KeyTool</a>, and emulating the above manual procedure.


<h4>Client certificate signing</h4>

We export a certificate signing request (CSR) to be signed by our local CA.
<pre>
$ keytool -keystore evanx.jks -alias evanx -certreq
</pre>
We cut and paste the output PEM text into a CSR file, and use Java7's keytool to sign this CSR, using its -gencert option, which by the way is not available in earlier JRE's.
<pre>
$ keytool -keystore ca.jks -gencert -validity 365 -rfc \
    -dname "CN=evanx" -infile evanx.csr -outfile evanx.signed.pem \
    -ext BasicConstraints:critical=ca:false,pathlen:0 \
    -ext KeyUsage:critical=digitalSignature \
    -ext ExtendedKeyUsage:critical=clientAuth
</pre>
where we specify an unchanged DN and validity period for the newly signed certificate. We might add some extensions for good measure, i.e. to restrict key usage.

We can inspect the cert using openssl.
<pre>
$ openssl x509 -text -in evanx.signed.pem
Certificate:
    Data:
        Version: 3 (0x2)
        Serial Number: 448957773 (0x1ac28d4d)
    Signature Algorithm: sha256WithRSAEncryption
        Issuer: CN=ca
        Validity
            Not Before: Oct 16 20:02:24 2013 GMT
            Not After : Jul 11 20:02:24 2016 GMT
        Subject: CN=evanx
        Subject Public Key Info:
            Public Key Algorithm: rsaEncryption
                Public-Key: (2048 bit)
</pre>
We see that the X509v3 extensions are set as follows.
<pre>

            X509v3 Basic Constraints: critical
                CA:FALSE
            X509v3 Extended Key Usage: critical
                TLS Web Client Authentication
            X509v3 Key Usage: critical
                Digital Signature
</pre>
Compare these settings to a cheap certificate e.g. from GoDaddy.com, as follows.
<pre>
        X509v3 extensions:
            X509v3 Basic Constraints: critical
                CA:FALSE
            X509v3 Extended Key Usage: 
                TLS Web Server Authentication, TLS Web Client Authentication
            X509v3 Key Usage: critical
                Digital Signature, Key Encipherment
</pre>
where we find that "Digital Signature" usage is required for client authentication, and "Key Encipherment" for server authentication.

Since the keystore requires its key certificate chain to be imported in the correct order starting with the root cert, we import the CA cert first, and then our signed cert.
<pre>
$ keytool -keystore evanx.jks -importcert -noprompt \
    -file ca.pem -alias ca
Enter keystore password: 
Certificate was added to keystore

$ keytool -keystore evanx.jks -importcert -noprompt \
    -file evanx.signed.pem -alias evanx
Enter keystore password: 
Certificate reply was installed in keystore
</pre>

<img align="right" style="margin-left: 4px" src="http://jroller.com/evanx/resource/gnome-keys-250.png" />

<h4>Client certificate management</h4>

Clearly a certificate with a duplicate CN impersonates the original certificate with that CN. So when issuing a client certificate, we must take care to ensure the uniqueness of the CN, and should add the certificate (or at least its unique identifier) to a registry of some sort. 

In order to review access, we clearly require a perfect record of all issued certificates. If a certificate is signed but not recorded, or its record is deleted, our server is forever vulnerable to that rogue certificate. 

We might record our signed certs into a keystore file as follows.
<pre>
$ keytool -keystore server.issued.jks -importcert -alias evanx -file evanx.pem 
Certificate was added to keystore
</pre>
where this is not a truststore per se, but just a database of issued certificates. Interestingly, in trying to avoid a truststore containing all our client certificates, we have nevertheless ended up with one! 

<h4>Self-signed client certificates</h4>

If our local CA is compromised by a breach, or abused by a rogue administrator, there is a risk of rogue certificates being issued, of which we have no record. 

To avoid the risk of rogue certificates, we might prefer self-signed client certificates which are explicitly imported into our server truststore, where they can be reviewed. 

Note that the server keystore must not be misused as its truststore, since the keystore naturally contains the server certificate, and so a rogue certificate can be created by signing it with the server key, e.g. using keytool -gencert, as illustrated above. 

Also when using CA-signed server certs, the server keystore contains the CA root key, and if misused as its truststore, then any client cert signed by that CA would trusted, rather than just the client certs we have specifically added to the truststore.

As a precaution, we might use an explicit trust manager, implemented as follows.
<pre>
public class ExplicitTrustManager implements X509TrustManager {
    Map<String, X509Certificate> certificateMap = new HashMap();
    X509TrustManager delegate;
    
    public ExplicitTrustManager(KeyStore trustStore) 
        throws GeneralSecurityException {
        this.delegate = KeyStores.findX509TrustManager(trustStore);
        for (String alias: Collections.list(trustStore.aliases())) {
            certificateMap.put(alias, (X509Certificate) 
                    trustStore.getCertificate(alias));
        }
    }
    ...
</pre>
where we build a map of the certificates in our truststore. 

We validate peer certificate chains as follows.
<pre>    
    private void checkTrusted(X509Certificate[] chain) 
            throws CertificateException {
        if (chain.length != 1) {
            throw new CertificateException("Invalid cert chain length");
        }
        X509Certificate trustedCertificate = certificateMap.get(
                X509Certificates.getCN(chain[0].getSubjectDN()));
        if (trustedCertificate == null) {
            throw new CertificateException("Untrusted peer certificate");
        }
        if (!Arrays.equals(chain[0].getPublicKey().getEncoded(),
                trustedCertificate.getPublicKey().getEncoded())) {
            throw new CertificateException("Invalid peer certificate");
        }
    }
</pre>
where we check that the first cert in the chain sent by the peer, is contained in our map.

We can use this trust manager on the server and client.
<pre>
    @Override
    public void checkClientTrusted(X509Certificate[] chain, String authType) 
            throws CertificateException {
        checkTrusted(chain);
        delegate.checkClientTrusted(chain, authType);
    }

    @Override
    public void checkServerTrusted(X509Certificate[] chain, String authType) 
            throws CertificateException {
        checkTrusted(chain);
        delegate.checkServerTrusted(chain, authType);
    }    
</pre>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

We can sign client certificates using a local CA root certificate. However, we should then support certificate revocation, e.g. to disable certificates for devices that have gone amiss. So we introduce a custom SSL trust manager to support a local revocation list. Naturally this is only useful is if we can configure our Java server to use it.

<img align="right" src="http://jroller.com/evanx/resource/Gnome-application-certificate-250-crop.png">

We discuss the risk of rogue certificates, and recommend using self-signed client certificates whenever possible, rather than a local CA as presented here.

We introduce an explicit trust manager, which only trusts the peer certificate if it is contained in the truststore, irregardless of its certificate chain. This protects against rogue certificates signed by trusted certificates.

<h4>Furthermore</h4>

We'll delve into the unit testing of our custom trust manager in a follow-up article. Thereafter, we might implement a local CA management tool that records issued certificates, and supports standard CRLs.
