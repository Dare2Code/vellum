In the <a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/evanx/archive/2013/01/24/password-salt">Password Salt</a> prequel, we suggested that the most secure passwords are no passwords, e.g. using Google Login, Facebook Connect, Mozilla Persona or what-have-you. Such an approach is simpler for developers and more convenient for end-users. However for internal enterprise apps, those login services might not be suitable, so...

<img align="right" style="margin-right: 4px" src="http://www.jroller.com/evanx/resource/wooden-shield.png" />

In said prequel, we presented an implementation using <tt>PBKDF2WithHmacSHA1</tt>, with a high number of iterations.

In this article, we cater for multiple revisions of the number of iterations and key size, and even migrate hashes on the fly to the latest revision when the user logs in.

<h4>PBKDF2</h4>

According to the <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet">OWASP Password Storage Cheat Sheet</a>,

  <i>General hashing algorithms (e.g. MD5, SHA) are not recommended for password storage. Instead an algorithm specifically designed for the purpose should be used such as bcrypt, PBKDF2 or scrypt.</i>

As presented in <a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/evanx/archive/2013/01/24/password-salt">Password Salt</a>, we salt, hash and match our passwords using PBKDF2 as follows.

<pre>
public class Passwords {
    public static final String ALGORITHM = "PBKDF2WithHmacSHA1";
    public static final int ITERATION_COUNT = 30000;
    public static final int KEY_SIZE = 160;

    public static byte[] hashPassword(char[] password, byte[] salt)
            throws GeneralSecurityException {
        return hashPassword(password, salt, ITERATION_COUNT, KEY_SIZE);
    }

    public static byte[] hashPassword(char[] password, byte[] salt,
            int iterationCount, int keySize) throws GeneralSecurityException {
        PBEKeySpec spec = new PBEKeySpec(password, salt, iterationCount, keySize);
        SecretKeyFactory factory = SecretKeyFactory.getInstance(ALGORITHM);
        return factory.generateSecret(spec).getEncoded();
    }

    public static boolean matches(char[] password, byte[] passwordHash, byte[] salt) 
            throws GeneralSecurityException {
        return matches(password, passwordHash, salt, ITERATION_COUNT, KEY_SIZE);
    }

    public static boolean matches(char[] password, byte[] passwordHash, byte[] salt,
            int iterationCount, int keySize) throws GeneralSecurityException {
        return Arrays.equals(passwordHash, hashPassword(password, salt, 
                iterationCount, keySize));
    }
}
</pre>

where we check if the supplied password, and its salt, matches our hash, using the given PBKDF2 parameters.

<h4>Measuring time</h4>

According to the aforecited <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet">OWASP Password Storage Cheat Sheet</a>,

  <i>One should measure the time required and make sure that it's as large as possible without providing a significantly noticeable delay when users authenticate.</i>

Let's measure the time required, albeit on our dev machine.

<pre>
    @Test
    public void testMatchesEffort() throws Exception {
        char[] password = "12345678".toCharArray();
        byte[] saltBytes = PasswordSalts.nextSalt();
        long startMillis = System.currentTimeMillis();
        byte[] hashBytes = Passwords.hashPassword(password, saltBytes, 30000, 160);
        System.out.println("hash time (30k): " + Millis.elapsed(startMillis));
        startMillis = System.currentTimeMillis();
        Passwords.hashPassword(password, saltBytes, 300000, 160);
        System.out.println("10x hash time (300k): " + Millis.elapsed(startMillis));
        startMillis = System.currentTimeMillis();
        assertTrue(Passwords.matches(password, hashBytes, saltBytes, 30000, 160));
        System.out.println("matches time: " + Millis.elapsed(startMillis));
        assertFalse(Passwords.matches(password, hashBytes, saltBytes, 30001, 160));
        assertFalse(Passwords.matches(password, hashBytes, saltBytes, 30000, 128));
        assertFalse(Passwords.matches("wrong".toCharArray(), 
                hashBytes, saltBytes, 30000, 160));
    }
</pre>

which prints the duration of the hashing and matching.

<pre>
hash time (30k): 181
10x hash time (300k): 1701
matches time: 167
</pre>

which shows the time in milliseconds for 30,000 iterations and also 10x that.

<h4>Storage</h4>

In order to revise the algorithm parameters e.g. if we migrate to a faster host, we need to store these parameters, together with the salt and the password hash, for each user.

We might extend our SQL credential table to include the PBKDF2 parameters as follows.

<pre>
   LOGIN VARCHAR(100) PRIMARY KEY,
   PASSWORD VARCHAR(32),
   SALT VARCHAR(32),
   PASSWORD_ITERATION_COUNT INTEGER,
   PASSWORD_KEY_SIZE INTEGER,   
</pre>

In the sequel, we'll consider encrypting the salt, which would require another field named <tt>SALT_IV</tt> (for the AES "initialization vector").

But let's try to migrate to salty passwords without changing our database schema so much, where we pack the password hash, salt and parameters into one field. We should be able to differentiate this from our legacy hash by its length.

<pre>
public class PasswordHash {
    private static final byte VERSION = 0x00;    
    int iterationCount;
    int keySize;
    byte[] hash;
    byte[] salt;
    byte[] iv;

    public PasswordHash(byte[] hash, byte[] salt, byte[] iv, 
            int iterationCount, int keySize) {
        this.hash = hash;
        this.salt = salt;
        this.iv = iv;
        this.iterationCount = iterationCount;
        this.keySize = keySize;
    }
    ...
</pre>

Given a new password and algorithm parameters, we generate salt, and hash the password as follows.

<pre>
    public PasswordHash(char[] password, int iterationCount, int keySize) 
            throws GeneralSecurityException {
        this.iterationCount = iterationCount;
        this.keySize = keySize;
        this.salt = PasswordSalts.nextSalt(); // e.g. random 16 byte array
        this.hash = Passwords.hashPassword(password, salt, iterationCount, keySize);
        this.iv = new byte[0];
    }
</pre>

We roll up the password hash, salt and parameters into a byte array for storage purposes.

<pre>
    public byte[] getBytes() throws IOException {
        int length = salt.length + hash.length + iv.length + 10;
        if (length >= 256) {
            throw new IOException("capacity exceeded: " + length);
        }
        ByteArrayOutputStream stream = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
        stream.write(VERSION);
        stream.write(length);
        stream.write(hash.length);
        stream.write(salt.length);
        stream.write(iv.length);
        stream.write(iterationCount >>> 16);
        stream.write((iterationCount >>> 8) & 0xff);
        stream.write(iterationCount & 0xff);
        stream.write(keySize >>> 8);
        stream.write(keySize & 0xff);
        stream.write(hash);
        stream.write(salt);
        stream.write(iv);
        return stream.toByteArray();
    }
</pre>

This byte array is then encoded using Base64 and stored in our <tt>PASSWORD</tt> column in the database. 

In order to authenticate a user's password, we unpack the hash, salt and parameters, from the byte array retrieved from the database. 

<pre>       
    public PasswordHash(byte[] bytes) throws IOException {
        ByteArrayInputStream stream = new ByteArrayInputStream(bytes);
        if (stream.read() != VERSION) {
            throw new IOException("mismatch version");
        }
        int length = stream.read();
        if (length != bytes.length) {
            throw new IOException("mismatch length");
        }
        hash = new byte[stream.read()];
        salt = new byte[stream.read()];
        iv = new byte[stream.read()];
        iterationCount = stream.read()<<16;
        iterationCount |= stream.read()<<8;
        iterationCount |= stream.read();
        keySize = stream.read()<<8;
        keySize |= stream.read();
        stream.read(hash);
        stream.read(salt);
        stream.read(iv);
    }
</pre>

where we allocate 3 bytes for the iteration count, which accomodates a maximum value of 16 million and some change. An alternative would be using a log-base-2 value used to calculate the iteration count. In this case, 1 byte would be more than sufficient, given that <tt>2^255</tt> is a 77-digit number. <i>Ooooo, that is a lot.</i>

We provide a method to authenticate a password against this hash-and-all.

<pre>
    public boolean matches(char[] password) throws GeneralSecurityException {
        millis = System.currentTimeMillis();
        try {
            return Arrays.equals(hash, Passwords.hashPassword(password, salt, iterationCount, keySize));
        } finally {
            millis = Millis.elapsed(millis);
        }
    }
</pre>

where we record the time taken to authenticate the password, for monitoring purposes, in order to assess the chosen <tt>iterationCount</tt> parameter in our production environment.

<h4>Testing</h4>

Let's test this and see what we end up with.

<pre>
    @Test
    public void testPasswordHash30k() throws Exception {
        testPasswordHash(30000, 160);
    }
    
    private void testPasswordHash(int iterationCount, int keySize) throws Exception {
        char[] password = "12345678".toCharArray();
        PasswordHash passwordHash = new PasswordHash(password, iterationCount, keySize);
        byte[] hashBytes = passwordHash.getBytes();
        passwordHash = new PasswordHash(hashBytes) ;
        assertEquals(iterationCount, passwordHash.getIterationCount());
        assertEquals(keySize, passwordHash.getKeySize());
        String encodedString = Base64.encode(hashBytes);
        assertTrue(PasswordHash.verifyBytes(hashBytes));
        assertFalse(passwordHash.matches("wrong".toCharArray()));
        assertTrue(passwordHash.matches(password));
        System.out.printf("iterationCount: %d\n", iterationCount);
        System.out.printf("keySize: %d\n", keySize);
        System.out.printf("byte array length: %d\n", hashBytes.length);
        System.out.printf("encoded string: %s\n", encodedString);
        System.out.printf("encoded length: %d\n", encodedString.length());
        System.out.printf("millis: %d\n", passwordHash.getMillis());
    }
</pre>

which prints,

<pre>
iterationCount: 30000
keySize: 160
byte array length: 46
encoded string: AC4UEAAAdTAAoMStc+T8jZ3jMBmaZk4x46kOQbmN0PmkTO4ewxND5ax4HkFLeg==
encoded length: 64
millis: 176
</pre>

Seeing that the Base64-encoded length is 64 characters, our <tt>PASSWORD</tt> column should be altered to <tt>VARCHAR(64)</tt> if required.

We test an iteration count greater than 16 bits to test our 3-byte packing, and also various key sizes. 

<pre>
    @Test
    public void testPasswordHash300k() throws Exception {
        testPasswordHash(300000, 160);
    }

    @Test
    public void testPasswordHashKeySize() throws Exception {
        testPasswordHash(10000, 128);
        testPasswordHash(10000, 256);
        testPasswordHash(10000, 512);
    }
</pre>

For a key size of 128 bits, we find the byte array length is 42, which we'll take as our minimum size.

<pre>
iterationCount: 10000
keySize: 128
byte array length: 42
encoded string: ACoQEAAAJxAAgLAycWjt9k2jEUTRAuFFqVEnsaphF9kesvzgS3hy0/M4
encoded length: 56
millis: 55
</pre>

For a key size of 2048, we exceed our byte array limit of 256 bytes. D'oh!

<pre>
    @Test(expected = IOException.class)
    public void testPasswordHash2048b() throws Exception {
        testPasswordHash(1000, 2048);
    }
</pre>

<h4>Migration</h4>

We provide a <tt>static</tt> method to confirm that the bytes are what our <tt>PasswordHash</tt> constructor would expect. 

<pre>
    public static boolean verifyBytes(byte[] packedBytes) {
        if (packedBytes.length < 42) {
            return false;
        }
        ByteArrayInputStream stream = new ByteArrayInputStream(packedBytes);
        if (stream.read() != VERSION) {
            return false;
        }
        int length = stream.read();
        int hashLength = stream.read();
        int saltLength = stream.read();
        int ivLength = stream.read();
        if (packedBytes.length != length || 
                length != hashLength + saltLength + ivLength + 10) {
            return false;
        }
        return true;
    }        
</pre>

where for a legacy unsalted password, the length will certainly be less than 42, which we noted above is the length we get with a 128 bit key size, and 16 byte salt.

Finally we migrate to salty passwords, on the fly, as follows.

<pre>
    public boolean matches(String user, char[] password, byte[] packedBytes) throws Exception {
        if (PasswordHash.verifyBytes(packedBytes)) {
            PasswordHash passwordHash = new PasswordHash(packedBytes);
            if (passwordHash.matches(password)) {
                monitor(passwordHash.getMillis());
                if (passwordHash.getIterationCount() != Passwords.ITERATION_COUNT
                        || passwordHash.getKeySize() != Passwords.KEY_SIZE) {
                    passwordHash = new PasswordHash(password,
                            Passwords.ITERATION_COUNT, Passwords.KEY_SIZE);
                    persistRevisedPasswordHash(user, passwordHash.getBytes());
                }
                return true;
            }
            return false;
        }
        if (matchesUnsalted(password, packedBytes)) {
            packedBytes = PackedPasswords.hashPassword(password);
            persistRevisedPasswordHash(user, packedBytes);
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
</pre>

where if the password is correct, but not at the latest revision, or still a legacy unsalted hash, we take the opportunity of migrating that user's password hash to the latest salty non-cracker.

As PCI compliance requires passwords to be changed every 90 days, admittedly it's not really necessary to migrate existing passwords to higher parameters, because a new password hash will be created soon enough :)

Finally, we <tt>monitor()</tt> the time taken to authenticate the password, e.g. to log hints to revise our iteration count. An upcoming article in the <a href="https://code.google.com/p/vellum/wiki/Timestamped">Timestamped</a> series will illustrate how we can gather time-series stats. We will record the sample size, minumum, maximum, average, and distribution of the duration of the hashing operation, for different iteration counts, aggregated by hour and day. Of course, this must be nicely graphed so we can visualise the state of affairs, at a quick glance :)

Incidently, in order to support multiple versions of <tt>PasswordHash</tt> itself, what elegant pattern would you advise?

<h4>Salt cipher</h4>

According to the oft aforementioned <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet">OWASP Password Storage Cheat Sheet</a>,

  <i>An additional password storage defense mechanism involves storing the salt in a different location than the password hash. 

  Use of the server's filesystem is one commonly used mechanism for salt isolation, assuming the password hashes are stored in a different location such as a database.</i>

As discussed in the prequel, it'd be simpler to encrypt the salt in the database, and store just the salt-encrypting key on the filesystem.

Indeed, the <tt>iv</tt> field of <tt>PasswordHash</tt> is an "initialization vector" as required for AES encryption of the salt. In the finale of this trilogy, we'll present that aspect. 

<h4>Summary</h4>

While SHA-2 is recommended these days for general hashing, we should use computationally expensive algorithms for password hashing, so that the passwords are harder to crack. 

In the prequel, we presented an implementation using <tt>PBKDF2WithHmacSHA1</tt>, with a high number of iterations. 

<img align="left" style="margin-left: 4px" src="http://jroller.com/evanx/resource/gnome-shield-250.png" />

Since the hashing operation should take as long as we are willing to make the user wait, the algorithm parameters must be tweaked according to our host's CPU.

We decide to encapsulate the hash, salt and parameters into a <tt>PasswordHash</tt> object. We serialize this object into a byte array, and encode with Base64 to store in our SQL database. In this case, we needn't change our database schema, besides expanding the <tt>PASSWORD</tt> field sufficiently. 

This supports revision of the number of iterations and key size. 

We can migrate to revised hashes when the user logs in and their password is thus on hand. Having said that, and seeing that PCI compliance requires passwords to be changed every 90 days, it's perhaps not necessary to migrate existing passwords to higher parameters when a new password hash will be created soon enough.

<h4>Coming up</h4>

In "Password Cipher," the finale of this sub-trilogy, we'll encrypt the password salt in our database, using... password-based encryption :)

Also, an upcoming article in the <a href="https://code.google.com/p/vellum/wiki/Timestamped">Timestamped</a> series will illustrate how we can gather time-series stats, including the time taken to authenticate the password. Such stats are required to revise our iteration count. 

We really should try out <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt">bcrypt</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrypt">scrypt</a>, and hopefully we will :)
