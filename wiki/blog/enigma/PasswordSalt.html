
This provides a long overdue update to "Password Hash" (2007) from the Enigma Prequels, where that article neglected to add salt, which is embarassing for whoever wrote that article... which was unfortunately me.

We know that passwords should be hashed, and hear they should be salted.

<img align=left style="margin-right: 10px" src='http://www.jroller.com/evanx/resource/salt-spoon-300.jpg'>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2">SHA-2</a> is recommended these days for general hashing, but we'll read that we should use computationally expensive algorithms for password hashing, so that the passwords are harder to crack. Just ask LinkedIn, who <a href="http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/15910/why-would-salt-not-have-prevented-linkedin-passwords-from-getting-cracked">learnt this lesson a few months ago</a> (2012).

The most secure passwords are no passwords, e.g. using Google Login, Facebook Connect, Mozilla Persona or some such provider. Such an approach simplifies our implementation effort, improves security, and makes registration and login more convenient for the end-user. So that's surely the way forward for consumer sites. However for internal enterprise apps, those login services might not be suitable. Perhaps the reader can recommend an opensource identity solution which one can use to handle passwords et al, in a PCI-compliant fashion? 

Having said that, since so many of us devs are lumbered with having to manage passwords, let's get stuck in.

<h4>Background reading</h4>

From https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet,

<blockquote>
General hashing algorithms (eg, MD5, SHA-1/256/512) are not recommended for password storage. Instead an algorithm specifically designed for the purpose should be used such as bcrypt, PBKDF2 or scrypt.
</blockquote>

<a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet"><img src="https://www.owasp.org/skins/monobook/ologo.png"/></a>

From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt,

<blockquote>
bcrypt is a key derivation function for passwords based on the Blowfish cipher.
</blockquote>

From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2,

<blockquote>
PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2) is a key derivation function that is part of RSA Laboratories' Public-Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS) series.
<br>PBKDF2 applies a pseudorandom function to the input password along with a salt value, and repeats the process many times. 
<br>The added computational work makes password cracking much more difficult.
<br>Having a salt added to the password reduces the ability to use precomputed hashes (rainbow tables) for attacks.
</blockquote>

<img align=right width=300 src=http://images.wisegeek.com/bowl-of-epsom-salt-with-scoop.jpg>
    
From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrypt,

<blockquote>
A password-based key derivation function (password-based KDF) is generally designed to be computationally intensive, so that it takes a relatively long time to compute (say on the order of several hundred milliseconds). 
<br>Legitimate users only need to perform the function once per operation (e.g., authentication), and so the time required is negligible. 
<br>However, a brute force attack would likely need to perform the operation billions of times at which point the time requirements become significant and, ideally, prohibitive.
</blockquote>

From https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Hashing_Java,

<blockquote>
If each password is simply hashed, identical passwords will have the same hash. This has two drawbacks:
<br>1. Due to the birthday paradox (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_paradox), the attacker can find a password very quickly especially if the number of passwords in the database is large.
<br>2. An attacker can use a list of precomputed hashes (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table) to break passwords in seconds.
<br><b>In order to solve these problems, a salt can be concatenated to the password before the digest operation.</b>
<br>A salt is a random number of a fixed length. This salt must be different for each stored entry. It must be stored as clear text next to the hashed password. 
<br>In this configuration, an attacker must handle a brute force attack on each individual password. The database is now birthday attack and rainbow crack resistant.
</blockquote>

Note that the sources "quoted" above have been surreptitiously paraphrased in some places, to suit ourselves ;)

<h4>Base64</h4>

Since we store password hashes and their salt in an SQL database, we encode those bytes into text using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64">Base64</a>.

For convenience, we introduce methods which delegate to our Base64 codec of choice e.g. from Apache commons, or the built-in Sun one.
<pre>
import sun.misc.BASE64Decoder;
import sun.misc.BASE64Encoder;

public class Base64 {
    
   public static String encode(byte[] bytes) {
      return new BASE64Encoder().encode(bytes);
   }

   public static byte[] decode(String string) {
      try {
         return new BASE64Decoder().decodeBuffer(string);
      } catch (Exception e) {
         throw new RuntimeException(e);
      }
   }
}
</pre>

Actually <a href="http://commons.apache.org/codec/">Apache Commons Codec</a> is a better choice as the Sun one gives compilations warnings to the effect that <i>"sun.misc.BASE64Decoder is Sun proprietary API and may be removed in a future release,"</i> but we take that with a pinch of salt, so to speak.

<h4>Psuedo salt</h4>

Apparently we must use <tt>SecureRandom</tt> to produce our salt, and not <tt>java.util.Random</tt>.

According to http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/security/SecureRandom.html, 
<blockquote>
This class provides a cryptographically strong random number generator (RNG).
</blockquote>

We read about <tt>SecureRandom</tt> vs <tt>Random</tt> on http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/random-number-generation-java, whilst enjoying <a href="http://search.dilbert.com/comic/Random%20Number%20Generator">Dilbert's comic RNG</a> :)

<pre>
public class PasswordSalts {
   public static final int SALT_LENGTH = 16;    
    
   public static byte[] nextSalt() {
      byte[] salt = new byte[SALT_LENGTH];
      SecureRandom sr = SecureRandom.getInstance();
      random.nextBytes(salt);
      return salt;
   }    
}
</pre>
where our salt is a 16 byte random number. Sooo easy :)

Let's have a closer look at the encoded salt.
<pre>
   @Test
   public void testSaltEncoding() throws Exception {
      byte[] saltBytes = PasswordSalts.nextSalt();
      String encodedSalt = Base64.encode(saltBytes);
      System.out.println(encodedSalt);
      assertEquals(encodedSalt.length(), 24);
      assertEquals(encodedSalt.substring(22, 24), "==");
   }
</pre>

<pre>
r2tWqOrfKpr64rpOwoRlcw==
</pre>

So apparently a 16 byte array encoded with <tt>Base64</tt> yields a 22 character string followed by two characters of padding. Superb!

<h4>Salt per password</h4>

When the user chooses a new password, we generate some salt for this specific password, and hash the password using this salt. We then save the salt and hash in the database, in the record for that user's login. 

The <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet">OWASP example</a> presents an SQL credential table with the columns:
<pre>
   LOGIN VARCHAR (100) PRIMARY KEY,
   PASSWORD VARCHAR (32),
   SALT VARCHAR (32)
</pre>

where we save the login's password <i>and</i> salt. 

<h4>Crypto parameters</h4>

So let's try PBKDF2. We'll leave Bcrypt and Scrypt for another day. Readers, please provide your opinions on these other options, and indeed PBKDF2, and the parameters and what-not presented here.

<pre>
public class Passwords {
   public static final String ALGORITHM = "PBKDF2WithHmacSHA1";
   public static final int ITERATION_COUNT = 8192;
   public static final int KEY_SIZE = 160;

   public static byte[] hashPassword(char[] password, byte[] salt)
          throws GeneralSecurityException {
      return hashPassword(password, salt, ITERATION_COUNT, KEY_SIZE);
   }

   public static byte[] hashPassword(char[] password, byte[] salt,
          int iterationCount, int keySize) throws GeneralSecurityException {
      PBEKeySpec spec = new PBEKeySpec(password, salt, iterationCount, keySize);
      SecretKeyFactory factory = SecretKeyFactory.getInstance(ALGORITHM);
      return factory.generateSecret(spec).getEncoded();
   }
   ...
</pre>

where we use <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/crypto/spec/PBEKeySpec.html"><tt>PBEKeySpec</tt></a> and what-have-you.

Let's test that this salting, hashing and matching actually works.
<pre>
   @Test
   public void test() throws Exception {
      char[] password = "12345678".toCharArray();
      byte[] salt = PasswordSalts.nextSalt();
      byte[] hash = Passwords.hashPassword(password, salt);
      assertTrue(Passwords.matches(password, hash, salt));
      byte[] otherSaltBytes = Arrays.copyOf(salt, salt.length);
      otherSaltBytes[0] ^= otherSaltBytes[0];
      assertFalse(Passwords.matches(password, hash, otherSaltBytes));
      assertFalse(Passwords.matches("wrong".toCharArray(), hash, salt));
   }
</pre>

where we use the following method to authenticate a supplied password, having retrieved the hash and salt from our database, and specifying the PBKDF2 parameters.

<pre>
   public static boolean matches(char[] password, byte[] passwordHash, byte[] salt) 
          throws GeneralSecurityException {
      return matches(password, passwordHash, salt, ITERATION_COUNT, KEY_SIZE);
   }

   public static boolean matches(char[] password, byte[] passwordHash, byte[] salt,
          int iterationCount, int keySize) throws GeneralSecurityException {
      return Arrays.equals(passwordHash, hashPassword(password, salt, 
              iterationCount, keySize));
   }
</pre>

Note that we use <tt>char[]</tt> so that provided passwords can be cleared from memory, e.g. using <tt>Arrays.fill()</tt> to zero the password array.

<h4>Computational effort</h4>

According to the <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet">OWASP Password Storage Cheat Sheet</a>,

<blockquote>
You should measure the time required and make sure that its as large as possible without providing a significantly noticeable delay when your users authenticate.
</blockquote>

Perhaps the time required to hash the password should be less than 100ms for consumer sites? I'm just guessing and don't really know so please comment. In the case of secure admin sites, probably we are happy with it taking a tad longer.

<pre>
   @Test
   public void testEffort() throws Exception {
      String password = "12345678";
      long startMillis = System.currentTimeMillis();
      byte[] saltBytes = Passwords.nextSalt();
      Passwords.hashPassword(password, saltBytes);
      System.out.println("time " + Millis.elapsed(startMillis));
      if (Millis.elapsed(startMillis) < 10) {
         System.out.println("Ooooooo.... i'm not sure");
      } else if (Millis.elapsed(startMillis) > 500) {
         System.out.println("Mmmmmmm.... i don't know");
      }
   }
</pre>

So given that CPU power is increasing every year, we need a dynamic solution where we can revise the parameters. So we might consider revising <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet">OWASP's</a> SQL credential table to include the PBKDF2 parameters as follows.

<pre>
   LOGIN VARCHAR (100) PRIMARY KEY,
   PASSWORD VARCHAR (32),
   SALT VARCHAR (32),
   PBKDF2_ITERATION_COUNT INTEGER,
   PBKDF2_KEY_SIZE INTEGER,   
</pre>

This would enable us to rehash passwords on-the-fly to higher parameters when a user logs in, and will be strategised in the sequel to this article, entitled "Password Rehash" :)

<h4>Furthermore</h4>

According to the <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet">OWASP Password Storage Cheat Sheet</a>,

<blockquote>
An additional password storage defense mechanism involves storing the salt in a different location than the password hash. Use of the server's filesystem is one commonly used mechanism for salt isolation, assuming the password hashes are stored in different location such as a database.
</blockquote>

<img align=right src='http://www.jroller.com/evanx/resource/sea-salt-crop.jpg'>
Rather than using the filesystem for salt storage per se, the salt could be encrypted in the database, and only the salt-encrypting key resides on the filesystem. Our app then uses this key to decrypt the salts retrieved from the database. In this case, both our database and filesystem need to be compromised, and password data and keystore both stolen, to effect password theft. <i>Yeah, baby!</i>

Furthermore, rather than employing a <tt>KeyStore</tt> file, it would be simpler to specify a password in our application configuration on the filesystem, for the purpose of password-based AES encryption of the salt. This will be presented in finale of this sub-series, entitled <i>"Password Cipher."</i>

So then we'd have an AES initialization-vector (IV) hard-coded in our source code, for a password specified as an application parameter on the filesystem, for the encryption of our logins' salted and hashed passwords stored in our database. This means our source code needs to be known, or jar stolen, together with the application configuration file, as well as the database login table, in order to have a crack at our password hashes. And hopefully that'll then require a supercomputer and more than a few days, to buy us some time to alert our users that their passwords are amiss and should be changed immediately.  

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

Passwords should never be seen or stored in clear text, or in any discernible or reversible fashion. 

While SHA-2 is recommended these days for general hashing, we should use computationally expensive algorithms for password hashing, so that the passwords are harder to crack.

Before hashing passwords, we must add salt, to protect against rainbow attacks and what-have-you.

We present an implementation using <tt>PBKDF2WithHmacSHA1</tt>. We read that other recommended alternatives are bcrypt and scrypt.

<img align=left src='http://media.mercola.com/imageserver/public/2010/August/8.25salt.jpg'> 
The hashing operation should take as long as we are willing to make the user wait, perhaps a few hundred milliseconds. So we should tweak the algorithm parameters appropriately, i.e. the key size and number of iterations of the password-based key derivation function.

Coming up in part 2, we will cater for multiple revisions, so we can increase the number of iterations and key size at some stage, and we'll illustrate how hashes might be migrated on the fly to the latest revision.

In part 3, we'll take a final step of encrypting the password salt in our database.
