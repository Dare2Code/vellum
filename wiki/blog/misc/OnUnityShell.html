enjoyed reading - thanks

I find that the Unity launcher is very similar to the Windows7 dock, except that it is on the left, which makes better use of today's wide screens. Vertical space is best used by applications rather than the shell. 

Furthermore, the Unity search and notifications is well done, and Ubuntu update and security is great. So, to my mind, it's the leading desktop OS and shell, bar none.  

Now as regards the bigger picture...

The benefits of a unified interface across phone/phablet and desktop in particular, will accrue. MS and Canonical are betting on this. That's not to mention the three other "screens of our lives" namely tablet, TV and IVI...

MS and Ubuntu desktop users are rankling at the change, but as users inevitably grow more attached to their phones than desktops, this strategy will appreciate.

On the Linux front, Canonical is more agile and community-based than Google, and best executes this unified vision. I invariably bet on Linux and opensource, and Canonical is the dark horse in this race :)

Canonical could replicate the success of Android and ChromeOS, with the understated advantage of an unified platform. I hope they induce developers of mobile apps. QML being Javascript-based, is well-chosen, in my opinion.
