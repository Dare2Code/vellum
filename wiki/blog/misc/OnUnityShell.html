This morning i enjoyed an article entitled <a href="http://www.unixmen.com/there-is-ubuntu-there-is-linux-and-then-there-are-others/">"There Is Ubuntu, There Is Linux And Then There Are Others"</a>, and here i rehash my comment there.

Chris Jones' article discusses how Microsoft and Canonical haven't listened to what their users want, which is the traditional "Start" desktop ala previous versions of Windows, GNOME 2 etc, not to mention KDE. Hence Windows 8 is not a breaking any sales records, and Linux Mint's Cinnamon is more popular than Unity.

<h4>The Wider Picture</h4>

Actually, I find that the Unity launcher is very similar to the Windows 7 dock, except that it is on the left, which to my mind, makes better use of today's wide screens. Vertical space is best used by applications rather than the shell, in my blinkered view ;)

My Windows 7 laptop screen is wide enough for Netbeans, web pages and what-not, but I definitely want more vertical space for scrolling said apps. So I put the dock on the left, just like Unity :)

My screen at work is too wide for all intent and purposes, to be honest. But at least Unity makes best use of that available screen-estate.

I hastened to add that the Unity search and notifications is well done, and Ubuntu update and security is great. So, to my mind, it's the best desktop OS and shell, bar none. 

I believe that Unity is designed for end-users by a team of UX experts hired by Canonical in London, rather than designed by hard-core developers. So i expect it to be "better" than GNOME and KDE, for the "mainstream," no offense to those truely great opensource developers, to whom so many owe so much. 

Although i have used both KDE and GNOME expensively since the last century (and i'm wrote this article on me mum's GNOME 2 pewter), these days I'm a Unity convert. For sure, there are some things not yet 100% for me, but that might just be me, or might just be not yet. But at least I know they have a decisive leader, professional designers, and a passionate community in attendance, and so some consideration, or patience, or both, is required by me.

When i started using bleeding-edge Unity a year or so ago (Ubuntu 11.10), it was falling over all the time, which was not suprising for a brand new shell. What was suprising is how quickly it stabilised around time of 12.04. I suspect this has to do with their pursuit for testable code. Interestingly, this is one of primary reasons offered for developing <a href='http://blog.cooperteam.net/2013/03/artistic-differences.html'>Mir</a>, and abandoning their Wayland plans. Other reasons appear to be their agility with respect to shell development, and support of Android graphics drivers. 

So here we have a brand new OpenGL-based shell, and unified display server, written from the ground up for a converged 3D-graphics world, with a dogged insistence on automated testing. I bow in admiration of their efforts, as much as i enjoy the fruits of their labour.

<h4>The Legacy</h4> 

Having said all that, i'm still too lazy to reinstall my Windows laptop, as per my cheeky 2006 article, <a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/evanx/archive/2006/05/my_desktop_os_w.html">My Desktop OS: Windows XP</a> ;) Incidently the person in that picture recently contacted me out of the blue. He is a most affable chap named Leslie Wilcock, and provided the following background information :)

Whilst searching for archive material about ICL I came across your blog. The guy in the picture loading a tape is myself, I used to work for ICL's 2900 Systems & Technical Support team. The picture was taken at the product development groups mainframe machine room in Kidsgrove in Stoke on Trent in about 1979.

<h4>The Bigger Picture</h4>

And now please allow me to espouse my opinions of the big picture.

The benefits of a unified interface across phone/phablet and desktop in particular, will accrue. MS and Canonical are betting on this. That's not to mention the three other "screens of our lives" namely tablet, TV and IVI.

MS and Ubuntu desktop users are rankling at the change, but as users inevitably grow more attached to their phones than desktops, this strategy will appreciate. Consumers want commonality between their desktop and phone, and producers want a unified platform for both. 

On the Linux front, Canonical is more agile and community-based than Google, and best espouses this unified vision. 

Canonical could replicate the success of Android and ChromeOS, with the crucial advantage of a unified platform. I hope they can induce developers of mobile apps. QML being Javascript-based, is well-chosen, in my opinion.

<h4>The Other Story</h4>

I was about to publish the sequel to <a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/evanx/archive/2013/01/24/password-salt">Password Salt</a> today, but now that will have to wait for next week, so stay tuned :)

On a related note, we <a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/03/cisco-switches-to-weaker-hashing-scheme-passwords-cracked-wide-open/">read</a> this week, that a recent Cisco update "leaves users considerably more susceptible to password cracking," since "Cisco's new method for converting passwords into one-way hashes uses a single iteration of the SHA256 function with no cryptographic salt." I don't believe it! ;)
