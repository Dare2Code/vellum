Here is a demo which is a jar which hosts embedded demos which are loaded via <tt>URLClassLoader</tt> looped back to a builtin webserver, also hosting the article that explains it all... Total download size? 115k! <i>(By the time you read this maybe more, but then it'll have more features :)</i>

I had so much fun today with this, it shouldn't be legal!

The code is on <a href="http://java.net/projects/webservlet">http://java.net/projects/webservlet</a>.

The next step is to try a nice splash screen, or interactive startup page, and/or login panel, to keep the user distracted while loading a larger application in the background (using <tt>URLClassLoader</tt>).
